(1) "Vivek Kantamani Final Project Report.pdf" is the report for the final project.
(2) The folder "Final Project Report Files" contains the additional files used in the report:

1. "breast_cancer_train.csv"
2. "final_model.RDS"
3. "Heatmap 1.png"
4. "Heatmap 2.png"
5. "Project Report.RMD"
6. "Project Report.PDF" - a duplicate of "Vivek Kantamani Final Project Report.pdf"

(3) "Model Evaluation.RMD" contains the function used to evaluate the model on the test data set.
It also includes code to produce a confusion matrix and to calculate the test error rate of the
model applied on the test data set.  

(4) "final_model.RDS" is a RDS file which contains the final model.



INSTRUCTIONS FOR EVALUATING TEST DATA SET:
1. For best results, please copy the unzipped folder "Vivek Kantamani Final Project" to a new location,
outside of the unzipping software.

2. Please place the test data set (e.g. "breast_cancer_test.csv") in the SAME DIRECTORY as
"Model Evaluation.RMD" and "final_model.RDS".

3. In "Model Evaluation.RMD" please assign the name of the test data set to the object
"test_data" (e.g. test_data = "breast_cancer_test.csv").

4. Run the code chunks to evaluate the performance of the model on the test data set.
